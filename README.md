# HRAnalytics

This was an Analytics Vidhya Competition. 

The goal is to employ a data-driven approach to predict if a particular employee should be promoted or not. Predictions will be based on a couple of features related to the employees. 

The problem of competition is formulated as a binary classification problem. The evaluation metric for the competition is F1 score. 

Steps Involved: Understanding and Preprocessing the Data, Model Building and Evaluation, SHAPLEY values for interpretability and Ensemble Learning. 

Soft Voting has given us the best F1 score (~0.47) of all models.
